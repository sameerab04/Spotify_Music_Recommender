# Spotify_Music_Recommender

The goal of this project is to utilize the Spotify dataset to identify similar songs and provide song recommendations based on inputted artists. The project aims to offer diverse recommendations by considering not only the most similar artists but also those who are slightly different.

We aim to address the following question: 
* How can we categorize our user base into distinct segments based on their  listening habits to tailor marketing strategies?

* Which artists or songs serve as bridges in the listening habits of our users, connecting different music genres or communities?

* How can we use content-based recommender method to to enhance user satisfaction?
